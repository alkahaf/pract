                The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York’s metro, already uses the same QR technology, and other companies like Coca-Cola and Kellogg’s are adding it to their packaging.

                VIA first tested the system through a pilot program in 2021, adding 100 NaviLens QR codes at San Antonio’s most-used bus stops. It leads the user to the bus stop, reads the QR code in any light condition, without focusing the mobile camera, and works even when a user is unaware they are near a code.
                
                U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, secured congressional funding for the technology in 2022. VIA trustees approved the plan to expand the program in January 2023.
                
                Having better resources for visually impaired commuters was VIA Trustee Athalie Malone’s goal when she took her seat in 2019. Malone, who is visually impaired, discovered NaviLens while helping to plan a trip to Europe.
                
                “I’ve only been blind 17 years,” Malone said. “When I lost my vision, I was still using the bus. … Where it got harder was to know which bus was coming.”
                
                The audible voice on the bus announcing each stop helped, but the app also helps guide her to the correct stop, she said.

                Vibrant Works, formerly named San Antonio Lighthouse for the Blind, partnered with VIA for the pilot program. Ernest Arce, who works at the nonprofit that provides jobs for visually impaired people as a sewing machine operator and uses VIA to get to work, was delighted to learn the system would be expanded to nearly all bus stops. 
                
                “That’s wonderful news,” he said Monday, standing outside the bus stop near his job. He hadn’t heard the system was being expanded, but was familiar with it because he’s a daily user at stops that already have NaviLens, including the one at his workplace.
